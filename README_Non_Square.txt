The code takes an input of two matrices with the pattern of nxm and mxp with m being the shared dimesion between the two matrices.
It then pads the matrices so that they are the closest power of 2 square matrix which allows for strassens method to be used.
It then divides up the matrices until they are of size one and then mutliplies them out.
You can run it by making your own matrices or using the test code I provided that gives examples of random sized matrices that follow the pattern.
