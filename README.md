## General Information
Implements and tests the Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for square matrices, the Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for non-square matrices, and the Coppersmith-Winograd Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for square matrices.


## Technologies Used
- Java


## Files
- StrassensMatrixMultiplication.java contains the Java class that implements Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for square matrices.
- Non_Square.java contains the Java class that implements Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for non-square matrices.
- CoppersmithWinograd.java contains the Java class that implements Coppersmith-Winograd's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for square matrices.
- SquareTestcases.java is the Java file for testing both the Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm and the Coppersmith-Winograd Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for square matrices.
- NonSquareTestcases.java is the Java file for testing the Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for non-square matrices.


## Usage
Run both SquareTestcases.java and NonSquareTestcases.java to test all three of the matrix multiplication algorithms on various-size matrices containing random integers. Both test files can be altered in order to extend the scope of matrix sizes being tested. 


## Project Status
